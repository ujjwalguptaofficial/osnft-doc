## Problem

Most of the organisation from small to enterprise today uses opensource project. But almost 99 % creators are unpaid and its very hard to keep doing without any monetory help.

👉 Also opensource projects needs contributors but contributors also are not rewarded because creator does not have anything to give.

<blockquote>
Every opensource project is like a small startup but it is runing without any income. It needs continuous income.
</blockquote>


## Solution

OSNFT is trying to solve this problem by converting the opensource project into a NFT without comprising on the opensource. The NFT can be used to earn and even reward to your contributors or your supporter.

👉 We want to motivate existing opensource creators and encourage others to opensource.
